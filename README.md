### User Story

1. The game should select a random word from a predefined word list.
2. The game should display the word as a series of underscores, one for each letter in the word.
3. The player should be able to guess letters by clicking on the letters of the alphabet provided.
4. If the player guesses a correct letter, the letter should be displayed in the correct position(s) within the word.
5. If the player guesses an incorrect letter, a part of the hangman diagram should be drawn.
6. The game should keep track of the number of incorrect guesses, and the game should end when the entire hangman diagram is complete (indicating a loss for the player).
7. If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word before the hangman diagram is complete, the player should win the game.
8. The game should provide a clear indication of the player's win or loss at the end of the game.
9. The game should allow the player to start a new game after completing a round.
